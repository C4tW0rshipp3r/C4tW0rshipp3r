- 👋 Hi, I’m @C4tW0rshipp3r
- 👀 I’m interested in firmware programming for IOT and automated agricultural applications
- 🌱 I’m completely new to coding, currently learning python and C++ (why? -masochism)
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything related to automation for greenhouses, grow rooms, etc.
-     My long term goal is an app-based interface to monitor and control automated systems for agricultural applications
